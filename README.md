# Health Prediction System

## Overview
The **Health Prediction System** is a web application that helps users assess their risk for various health conditions, including **heart disease, diabetes, and stroke (brain disease)**. Using **Machine Learning models**, the system takes user input, processes it, and provides a health risk assessment along with personalized recommendations.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Register and log in to access health predictions.
- **Health Predictions**:
  - Heart Disease Risk Prediction
  - Diabetes Risk Prediction
  - Stroke (Brain Disease) Risk Prediction
- **Personalized Health Advice**: Users receive tailored health improvement suggestions based on their results.
- **Secure & Private**: User data is protected and used only for predictions.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript , Gsap , Locomotive Js , Tilt Js 
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning Models**: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
- **Database**: SQLite (or any preferred database for user management)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-prediction-system.git
 cd health-prediction-system
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and go to **http://127.0.0.1:5000/** to use the application.

## Usage Guide
1. **Sign up / Log in** to access the system.
2. Select a prediction model (**Heart, Diabetes, or Brain Disease**).
3. Enter your health details.
4. Click "Predict" to get your health risk assessment.
5. View recommendations to improve your health.

## Machine Learning Models
The system uses trained **ML models** for health risk prediction:
- **Heart Disease**: Logistic Regression / XGBoost
- **Diabetes**: Decision Tree / Random Forest
- **Brain Disease (Stroke Prediction)**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Models are saved using `pickle` and loaded for predictions.

## Future Enhancements

- **📌 Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR)**
- **📌 Advanced AI Chatbot for medical consultation**
- **📌 More ML models with improved accuracy**
- **📌 A Mobile App version**
- **📌 Login & User Data Storage for a more personalized experience**
- **📌 Improved Document Scanning with OCR for better medical insights**
